There are fundamentally two systems of magic within the world. The first, [[FieldMagic]] , is a well understood system which involves manipulation of [[TheField]] a field of magic that permeates through the world and can be controlled through ancient languages and symbology. The second, [[DivineMagic]] ,is not necssearily separate from the first, but is much less understood and much more powerful though it is signifigantly less predicatable, almost all practitioners are [[TheGods]] and those close to them.

===== [[FieldMagic]] =====
The magic propogated by the field can be controlled by those with knolwedge of one of the [[MagicLanguages]] and the [[MagicForms]] , a set of Languages and methods of forming shapes respectivley. (See [[FieldMagic]] )

===== [[DivineMagic]] =====
The Magic of [[TheGods]] is related to [[TheField]] however it is different, often not requiring special forms to practice, and is rarley if ever used by mortals.
