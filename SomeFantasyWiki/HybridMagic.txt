Created Thursday 11 March 2021

Hybrid magic is a combination of [[FieldMagic]] and [[DivineMagic]] frequently praciticed by mortals who have recived some level of divine power from a divine being. This form usually does not allow the practitioner to bypass form or langauge requirments, though it often will partially bypass energy ones. Divine power can in a way be thought of as another energy soruce to drawn from when preforming [[FieldMagic]] . Though i frequently can only be used in ways related to the being it was granted by.
